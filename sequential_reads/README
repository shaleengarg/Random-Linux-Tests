The linux kernel has a little prefetching engine for reads:

Observation:
1. while forward sequential reads are identified by this prefetching engine, it is unable to identify backward sequential reads.

This is primarily because the engine checks the last 32 pages (128KB ) of page cache to determine if the reads are sequential. It doesnt look at the leading pages
