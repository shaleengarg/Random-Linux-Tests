In this test, I am trying to see if I can write a struct atomically by using bitwise operators


Here we have a 64 Bytes of cacheline size
each integer is 8 Bytes - > So we can have 8 integers

OK -> Realization
When we left shift a variable, it is left shifted in its bit space, not in cache line.

Hence it is difficult to write something greater than a variable atomically using left shifts

ie. To write a complete cache line(say) at once needs some support from instrinsics
